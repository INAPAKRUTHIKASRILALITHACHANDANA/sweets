        <p>Gajar Ka Halwa, also known as Carrot Halwa, is a beloved Indian dessert that's rich, aromatic, and utterly delicious. It's made by grating fresh carrots and cooking them in a combination of milk, sugar, and ghee (clarified butter) until the mixture thickens and the carrots become tender. As it simmers, the carrots absorb the flavors of cardamom, saffron, and sometimes nuts like almonds or cashews. The result is a luxurious, sweet treat that's often served warm, garnished with more nuts for added texture and flavor. Gajar Ka Halwa is especially popular during festivals and celebrations, but it's so tasty that it's enjoyed year-round as well!</p>
